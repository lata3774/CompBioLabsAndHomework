## Lab 08: Documentation and Metadata
This script has two basic parts: creating and calling the logistic growth model function, and writing the output of the function to a .csv file.
### Logistic growth function
The function `logisticGrowthModel` returns a vector of population abundances per generation for a logistic growth model following the equation: 
```
n[t] = n[t-1] + ( r * n[t-1] * (K - n[t-1])/K )
```
To work, this function requires four inputs:
* `r` = intrinsic growth rate (any number)
* `K` = environmental carrying capacity (any positive integer)
* `generations` = number of generations (any positive integer)
* `nStart` = the initial population abundance (any positive integer)


The function has two uses: it returns a matrix of population abundances per generations, and it prints a plot of the data to RStudio.

This script calls the function and names its output `logisticModel`.
### Writing the data set to a file
The final line of the script writes the data set generated by the function `logisticGrowthModel` to a .csv file in the working directory.
```
write.csv( x = logisticModel, file = "Lab08Data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
The name of the file can be changed by editing `file = "filenamehere.csv"`.
